# Categoro
Helps you sort your images into classification folders.

## Installing Categoro
* **Be sure you have at least Java 8 installed!** If not, download it from [Java's website](https://www.java.com/download/).
* Go to the [Releases](http://github.com/Techzune/Categoro/releases/latest) page and download the latest **.JAR** file.
* Save the **.JAR** file to where you would like the program to be and run it.

## Using Categoro
Categoro uses project directories to help you sort your images.
1. **Create a directory** for your images to be sorted in.
2. Open Categoro and **select that directory** for your project.
3. **Define a project name and classes** you wish to have. With each class, you must define a key to press to pick that class.
   NOTE: You cannot use "unsorted" as a directory name. This will hold all your unsorted photos.
4. Click **Start Sorting**.
5. There will be no images to sort, so you can **close Categoro**.
6. Go to that directory and **add you photos to sort** into the **unsorted** directory.
7. Open Categoro, **select that directory again**, and it should load your previous configuration.
8. Click **Start Sorting**.
9. Using the keys you defined, **press the correct classification** for the image showing.
   Use X to skip the current image or Z to return to the previous image.
10. Have fun!

Really, no idea. I just came up with it stuck with it.
